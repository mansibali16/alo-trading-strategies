# Rejection Candle Indicator 
Rejection Candle Indicator used to identify potential reversals in price action.


The Rejection Candle Indicator is a popular tool in technical analysis
used to identify potential reversals in price action. It is based on the concept of price
rejection, where the market shows a strong rejection of a certain price level, typically
forming a candle with a long wick and a small body. This pattern suggests that the
market has attempted to push the price in one direction but was met with strong
opposition, leading to a reversal or at least a pause in the current trend. Traders use this
indicator to spot key turning points in the market and make informed trading decisions.
